# Python_Instacart
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app.

# Objective
Instacart already has outstanding sales, but wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Key questions: 
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in their system's different types of customers and how their ordering behaviors differ.
